Through leveraging data from GH Archive, I've developed an Extract, Transform, Load (**ETL**) pipeline to clean raw data, insert it into a centralized **data lake**, and process it into a structured **data warehouse** for analysis. The pipeline handles both **batch processing** for historical data and **real-time hourly updates**. By implementing this pipeline, I aimed to provide improved **insights into GitHub activity** while ensuring **data reliability** and facilitating future advanced **analytics**. 

<u><b>Tools</b></u>: **Python**, **Git**, **Pyspark/Apache Spark 3**, **Google Cloud**(Cloud Run, Google Cloud Storage, Google BigQuery), **Terraform**, **Mage Orchestrator**, **Looker Studio**
