I refactored an old game I developed years ago, leveraging **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles** and the **MVP (Model-View-Presenter) pattern**. This transformation not only improved performance but also enhanced scalability and flexibility for future updates.

The game challenges players to dominate the board strategically by purchasing resources. Available in both **Spanish and English**, it supports multiplayer modes for **two players or solo play against AI**. Dive in to explore this project!

<u><b>Tools</b></u>: **Python**, **git**, **venv**
