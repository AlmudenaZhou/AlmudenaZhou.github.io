A refactored version of a strategy game I made, enhanced using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles** and the **MVP (Model-View-Presenter) pattern** to improve performance and flexibility for future updates.

**Highlights:**

- **Enhanced Architecture:** Leveraged **OOP** principles and the **MVP pattern** to restructure the game, ensuring clean separation of concerns and easier maintainability.
- **Multilingual Support:** Available in both Spanish and English.
- **Game Modes:** Supports **multiplayer** for two players or solo play **against an AI** opponent.
- **Optimized Performance:** Refactoring significantly **improved game efficiency** and responsiveness.

**Impact:** Revitalized a legacy project by applying a modular software development approach, improving maintainability and scalability.
